<p align="justify">Consumers have a variety of service and product options in modern life. As a result, people's expenses have skyrocketed in comparison to a decade before, and the cost of living has been steadily rising. To live a decent life with a correct budget set up, it becomes necessary to keep track of spending.
The Expense Tracker, XTRACKER, was created for desktop users to keep track of their expenses and evaluate if they are spending within their budget. Potential users must enter the necessary information, including the expense category, number, amount, optional brief description, and date of the expense. Users can utilize pie charts to track their costs on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.</p>
